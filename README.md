> Low tier python and C++ developer

Hello there I am Hannah, a python and C++ developer who has a love hate relationship with C++ for loops. 
Currently learning front end development because employers look for that and I kinda want a job so yk.

Although the course I take at GCSE does not teach programming I am a self taught dev who knows the
basics and more on both languages I know.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  std::cout << "Fun";
}
```

For some reason I like the complexity of C++ and find it easier to learn than python which I aready Knew a bit about from school, 
having a fresh language I know nothing about helps me focus on parts I know I need to learn rather than what I think I do and do not know.

## Why I enjoy IT
My interest first peaked learning batch in year nine, I was a silly kid back then messing around making bat malware and bypassing system
restrictions with it. I then moved onto python and found it to be a beautiful and powerful language for me to learn, this with a 
combination of interest for cybersecurity and malware has kept me in IT constantly learning new things.

I am not sure how IT aligns with my personal goals but my personal projects demonstrates my commitment for this passion.

Over time and working on my personal project I have seen a significant improvement in my problem solving skills specifically in
mathematical scenarios it has helped me think logically and on my GCSE Math's Non Calculator paper 1 mock paper in Novemeber 2023 
there was a question where we had to reverse the equation and I remembered deobfuscation and reverse engineering and how I did it,
this got me an extra 6 marks on that paper.
