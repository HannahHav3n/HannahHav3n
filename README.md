> Low tier python and C++ developer

Hello there I am Hannah, a python and C++ developer who has a love hate relationship with C++ for loops. 
Currently learning front end develoment because employers look for that and I kinda want a job so yk.

```c++
#include <iostrea>

int main(){
  std::cout < "Fun";
}
```

For some reason I like the complexity of C++ and find it easier to learn than python which I laready Knew a bit about from school, 
having a fresh language I know nothing about helps me focus on parts I know I need to learn rather than what I think I do and do not know.
